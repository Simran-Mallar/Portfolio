## Projects
### Sung-Geet: Personalized Music Player Using Real-time Facial Emotions 
[Publication](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2406838.pdf)

Created a personalized music recommender system that leverages live facial expressions captured via webcam to suggest songs based on the user's emotional state. Utilized MTCNN for real-time face detection and fine- tuned MobileNet for emotion classification, employing the FER2013 dataset to ensure robust emotion recognition. Implemented advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and overfitting techniques, surpassing existing system accuracy rates by 10â€“20%. Delivered personalized music recommendations in Hindi and English, enhancing the user experience through a dynamic and interactive platform. 

### Multiple Disease Prediction System 
Designed a prediction model leveraging machine learning algorithms and user metrics such as blood pressure, heart 
rate, and other pertinent variables. The project includes three sections: an information page detailing the diseases, a 
prediction system for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease, and a treatment section offering remedies for 
these conditions. This facilitated the identification of significant health risk indicators related to prevalent conditions 
affecting 1 in 4 adults globally. 

### Grocery Bill Management System  
Built a simple and efficient billing system using Python, SQLite3, and Tkinter to make supermarket transactions smoother. The system lets users add products to a cart with a single click, automatically calculating the total price, including GST. It swiftly creates bills, helps retrieve past invoices, and ensures accurate and hassle-free billing. With an easy-to-use interface, it simplifies the checkout process, making customer service faster and more efficient.
