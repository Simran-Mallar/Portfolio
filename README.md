Crafted a sophisticated web application that delivers personalized movie suggestions tailored to user preferences. 
- ***COVID-19 Analysis using Tableau***: Developed a Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze COVID-19 data across India, tracking the progression of cases, deaths, and recoveries over time. Mapped regional hotspots, demographic impacts by age and gender, and tracked vaccination progress, providing comprehensive insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Projects
### Sung-Geet: Personalized Music Player Using Real-time Facial Emotions 
[Publication](https://www.jetir.org/papers/JETIR2406838.pdf)

Created a personalized music recommender system that leverages live facial expressions captured via webcam to suggest songs based on the user's emotional state. Utilized MTCNN for real-time face detection and fine- tuned MobileNet for emotion classification, employing the FER2013 dataset to ensure robust emotion recognition. Implemented advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and overfitting techniques, surpassing existing system accuracy rates by 10–20%. Delivered personalized music recommendations in Hindi and English, enhancing the user experience through a dynamic and interactive platform. 

### Multiple Disease Prediction System 
Designed a prediction model leveraging machine learning algorithms and user metrics such as blood pressure, heart 
rate, and other pertinent variables. The project includes three sections: an information page detailing the diseases, a 
prediction system for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease, and a treatment section offering remedies for 
these conditions. This facilitated the identification of significant health risk indicators related to prevalent conditions 
affecting 1 in 4 adults globally.
